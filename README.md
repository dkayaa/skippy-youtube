## What ?
A browser plugin that uses AI text classification to detect and scrub advertisement content from Youtube videos in real-time. 
## Why ? 
Improve the Youtube user experience by automatically skipping those in-video ad reads that were going to be skipped anyway. 
## How ? 
When a user navigates to a Youtube video URL, a request is sent to the backend server to execute the following; the back-end first retrieves the relevant audio transcript and timestamps, leveraging the python's `youtube-transcript-api` library. The transcript undergoes a preprocessing step whereby it is split into overlapping text chunks. Each chunk is then processed by a text-classification model. Specifically, we leverage the pretrained `distilbert-base-uncased` model, fine tuned on a manually curated dataset of 3K+ labelled samples, to employ binary classification for each text chunk as either an advertisement or not. 

## Local Setup 
The plugin and server can be deployed for local use.
- Deploy the project containers using the setup script `cd server; bash run.sh`
- Copy the serveo.net url forwarding traffic to the server. It should be of the form `https://xxx.serveo.net`
- Navigate to the browser*, type `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`
- Click `Load Temporary Add-on` and select `manifest.json` 
- Navigate to the plugin configuration menu and paste the serveo url and hit save.

*Currently only supports Firefox
